# .vim
My vim configuration, including plugins as git submodules. Tim Pope doesn't like to go crazy... I do.


## Usage

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/cesalazar/.vim.git ~/.vim

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.


## Extras
The fonts are for airline/powerline and must be installed on the **host** terminal
